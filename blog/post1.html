            <h2 class="card-title">Driving to the unknown</h2>
            <h4 class="card-text">Sometimes you have no sense of direction, other times you just know the only way it's straight ahead!</h4>
            <p class="card-text">Like many of you, I am trying to find my way to accomplish my dreams.</p>
            <p class="card-text">I've always been a student of life, learning, and learning, watching tutorials after tutorials, admiring people on youtube that just seem to have everything together.</p>
            <p class="card-text">But you know what?! I'm done with it, I've pushed the start button and I won't stop until I run out of gas.</p>
            <p class="card-text">My life suddenly changed in 2012 when without expecting it I had the opportunity to study abroad for a year as an Erasmus student in Barcelona. I had no idea that it would change my life so much. I was scared but my excitement was way stronger.</p>
            <p class="card-text">I bought a plane ticket to Barcelona and said goodbye to my family and friends in Portugal. A new life was expecting me! There was a friend of mine living the same experience as me in the same city, but we were in different universities.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Pretty soon each of us found ourselves making our own social groups and different paths, but from time to time we would see each other at our houses, events or parties.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Needless to say that I had a great time in Barcelona, it is very easy to get lost in the streets and end up at 4 am talking with strangers and visiting new bars and new places.</p>
            <p class="card-text">One of the things that I am most grateful for is the best friends that I made: </p>
            <p class="card-text">- My best friend that was with me all the time, that would show me all the best electronic parties and share the most weird and awesome moments, and with whom I also learned some words of Euskera.</p>
            <p class="card-text">- My Italian Erasmus sister that was also my roommate and craziness accomplice, we would throw awesome parties at our house and drive our german roommates mad, they had it coming by the way.</p>
            <p class="card-text">- My Catalan supergirl friend always energetic and eager to keep going and have the most out of every moment, I admired her strong will and hard work as she saved the money to throw herself out of an airplane with the arms wide open and an inspiring sentence written on them.</p>
            <p class="card-text">- And to the other two awesomely cool guys on our group, one Italian another Catalan, that would crash in our sofas and our house and always appear even if I was sleeping to take me out of the house and explore the city.</p>
            <p class="card-text">After one year my Erasmus ended and I returned to Portugal, but I my eyes were wide open and I had returned with a different perspective on the way of living. Life is full of new and exciting experiences, being nervous about something just means it is worth the effort.</p>
            <p class="card-text">Stay tuned for the next post, as I deal with the lows of the life after Erasmus and the ups of new adventures ...</p>
            <p class="card-text">And remember: Belief is the vehicle on the road of your Dreams.</p>
